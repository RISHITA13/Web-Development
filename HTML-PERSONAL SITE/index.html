      <h1>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
    </strong> </h1>It is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.<br><br>
    <em>Most people infected with the <b>COVID-19</b> virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.<br>
      Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.<br>
      The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the <b>COVID-19</b> virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads.<br>
      Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.</em></p>
  <h3>
    <ul> <b> Common symptoms include:</b>
  </h3>

  <li>fever</li>
  <li>tiredness</li>
  <li>dry cough.</li>

  </ul>

  <ul>
    <h4> Other symptoms include:</h4>

    <li> shortness of breath</li>
    <li> aches and pains</li>
    <li> sore throat</li>
    <li> and very few people will report diarrhoea, nausea or a runny nose.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should self-isolate and contact their medical provider or a COVID-19 information line for advice on testing and referral.<br>

    People with fever, cough or difficulty breathing should call their doctor and seek medical attention.</p>
